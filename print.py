#This is my first python line.
#print is a function that outputs text to the console.
#() is called parentheses, and it is used to pass arguments to the function.
#() is used to make a fixed value, which is a value that does not change. You can only change the value by changing the code.
#() can also be used to define a function, or make a tuple. Tuple is list of values that cannot be changed, unless you change the code.
#So, () can be changed only manually, not by user input. It's different from [], which you can change by user input.
#in Python, we use # to write comments that explain the code, and these comments are not executed by Python.

print("Hellow Worldies!!!!!")
print('My name is Nawa\n')
print("Iam learning Python and i think it is very cool")
print("I can't wait to learn more\n")
#'aaaa' is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
#""/'' are used to define strings in Python.

print("""I am very excited to learn more about Python,
and I hope to become proficient in it soon.\n
My dream now is to become a developer.\n""")
#"""aaaa""" is a multi-line string, which allows you to write text across multiple lines without using \n for new lines.
#without """ you would have to use \n to create new lines. It's like a paragraph.
#but \n here is used to add a space between the two paragraphs.

print("Python is fun,\n" + "and amazing!\n")
#\n is a newline character that creates a new line in the output. It's like pressing Enter on your keyboard.
#+ is the concatenation operator, which combines two strings together. It's like plus in math, but for strings.

#This is a commitment
print("I WANT TO LEARN PYTHON\n" * 5)
#* is the multiplication operator, and it repeats the string 5 times.
